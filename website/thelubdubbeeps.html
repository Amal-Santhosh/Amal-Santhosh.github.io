	<h2>The 'Lub-Dub' Beeps</h2>
	<p>Better than the 'lub-dub'<br>
     The beep made my heart ponder<br>
     Over the phone.<br>
     Seeing your name above all notification<br>
     Was nothing else than the drop<br>
     Carrying oxygen for survival<br>
     What my eyes seek were<br>
     Printed on the screen with beauty<br>
     And love from where it comes from.<br>
     Excited every neurons, the way<br>
     Which carries the words, and<br>
     The whole life when it is reached.
