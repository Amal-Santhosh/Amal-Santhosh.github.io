	<h2>The Last Kiss</h2>
	<p>As the moon cast its shadow over the evening light, he went to the corner, waiting for her. It was blind, dark and invisible to those popping eyes through the windows of the street, where pounding hearts waited for their hands to be grabbed and melodious rhythm playing in their hearts. He felt different and difficult that night, as he was walking to the corner. He could hardly walk to the spot, as if he had a huge bag and a mammoth suitcase which he had to drag with difficulty. He came to the street with his red dotted huge bag and blue coloured mammoth suitcase which made sounds from the wheels as it rolled down the road. People around the street thought he was crippled as his body couldn’t hold the weight he was carrying. He moved into the street as a crippled.<br> 
He was not a good friend of all, though he tried, almost everyone found him weird as if he was from an alien planet; living in his own reality. He smiled at people who passed across him, all of them, which made him odd. The world lost people who smiled at everyone they saw and also, people who talk about their dreams. Between all the people running above time, he saw those legs walking. Slow, like she didn’t want the current time to pass. <br>

Those same legs came close towards him to the corner, wanting this time also not to pass. She was in her light coloured, loose outfit, as usual with not much make-up. She knows that he will be waiting there, it was all planned, and maybe this moment went through their heads from the moment their eyes stuck for the first time at the pathway. It wasn't a love at first sight as in novels, but there was something from the beginning. He was odd as was she, a little weirder at times. The street wasn't a city street where you don't know the person living next door, but it was less populated with slower watches for people to know each other. It was easy for them to meet, talk and to be in each other's company, as both were of the same age and had bundles of bound books to talk about. <br>

They had reasons to be together. They went to the cafe at the same time, where special chicken samosas were served hot. Having samosa and cold lime they talked at the cafe for long hours without people noticing, though some friends joined them at times.  With time, it became their meeting spot and two samosas in different plates gradually shrunk into one plate. It took months after they started seeing each other for the curious case of samosas to get revealed. They were walking past the cafe, holding hands, now they don’t have to sit inside the cafe to talk or to escape the gazes from people. As she told him about the sweet and spicy samosas her mother used to make and how she found the special ones in the cafe similar to those, he told the story behind his samosa craving, adding chilly and tomato sauce to their cafe dates.<br>

It started raining after two weeks of his arrival in the street. Surprised  and soaked by the first rain in the middle of his exploration in the neighbourhoods, he ran to the nearest building. The cafe was on the corner of the building which had glass walls on both sides filled with pictures of steaming tea, hot samosas with a small heart balloon, veg and chicken rolls, the text ‘juices of all kind’ with pictures of orange, apple and pineapple and a board mentioning the special samosa at the corner where both the glass walls met. The first rain was hitting the windows so hard and shattering back at him as if it was announcing its arrival to everyone around the area. Admiring the smell of the first rain, watching raindrops dancing along the window, like if it is the law of nature and mandatory that someone beautiful should be seen adding charm to the scene, he saw a girl in a black jacket sitting in the corner with samosas in her hand. It was the special samosa which he discovered later, adding more beauty to his memories. The girl was in the corner. He could see her but not in a way he could admire her beauty. Her face was half covered by the jacket and the strands of her hair were dancing along the wind. She had long hair, not coloured. She is beautiful or he imagined her to be beautiful. Nothing less than beautiful could have caught his attention. As his mind imagined her alluring face, his glass was covered with the raindrops veiling his vision. He took off the glass, cleaned it with his shirt, adding more water and making it worse, and all of a sudden with the rain stopping as an announcement of her return. She vanished from his sight.<br>

Love is everywhere like the flu. More susceptible people will easily catch it and people with weak hearts and bodies will carry it with them. The first rain and first sight of that beautiful girl was too irresistible to him. Trying his luck and hankering to see her, he went to the cafe the next day. He ran his eyes through the glass wall painted with food items, searching for the girl. ‘The girl’ was difficult to find. Anyone could be the girl and the black jacket wasn’t rare. The black board wasn’t there, which had special samosa written in big fonts to connect the pictured walls, and he couldn't find any girl similar to his imaginations.<br>

No matter how unlucky he thought he was, there is always something in love that drags you. And on the third day, with the black board connecting the pictures with its special samosa, he saw a girl sitting at a table in the corner. It's the same table, and she was wearing a white top, a little large for her with some abstract picture of a flower, a pair of eyes, hands holding together and some birds flying, all drawn together. She was eating a samosa, and he had his wild guess that it's the same girl he saw two days back. <br>

'Then I named you the samosa girl' he said, 'and that's from where I started carving for samosas'. 'Were you stalking me? Idiot!', she said with a smile and hug, adding sauces to the hot samosa. <br>

“Are you staring at me?’, she asked with a laugh as she moved closer to the corner. ‘Did I make you wait?’ - she had to ask him, but she didn’t. She knows that he will be there early, so that he won't miss her sight for any moment. She came close and looked for his open hands for her to hug. Everything was slow that night. They hugged, deep and long. He had one book in his hand. He showed it to her with a thanking smile, ‘here, it was with me’, he said. It was ‘The broken wings’ by Khalil Gibran. <br>

Along with the special samosas, one among the many reasons for them to be together was books. He was only committed to books till the day he was soaked in rain and stood outside the cafe in the new street. As the street became familiar and the people living there, he found his commitment extending to the beautiful long haired girl who he saw through the cafe windows. She was a good company for him, her taste in books matches his on many grounds as her taste in food. No books ever escaped the essence of love, grief and all the emotions in between, and the readers too. Like books finding its place in shelves, quiet and deep, the one who reads also finds best when they are in a quiet safe space, and those who discuss books always need somewhere safe to fight their arguments. <br>

The unbreakable lock is which you have the key for. They built locks with whatever they had in common, and they kept the key making it unbreakable. Books were the hardest of it and the broadest. They were never out of things to talk about. Thanks to those books which always gave them something to talk about, from the green grasshopper lying among the green grass, invisible, to those dark clouds above them with shapes of animals. They talked about love, and they never needed any good reason to talk about love than those verses written by Rumi and grieved together at elegies. <br>

'Do you like a guy who enjoys talking to you and feels like home?', he said, 'How much do you think you like me?'. They were in their reading lawn, high and away from the street. They had cars buzzing around, children running and crying at their loudest voices, men and women working hard to meet the ends, metals clanking, words written over and over, and never stopping printing machines to their back, on the street. But they looked above where clouds lie unfilled with stories, where wind blew through their hairs. Like a book in the safe, they were safe there. 'You know, I love you', she said, 'I love being with you, I like the idea of loving you'. 'You can write a poem', he said laughing, 'everything about love and of love'. <br>

She was always beautiful. She was beautiful in the mornings, and sometimes even more at nights. That night was one of them. Seeing her coming to him, even for the hundredth time he was numb. He would have written thousands of verses praising her beauty, how he will love her, but nothing came out, ever. ‘How am I looking?’ She asked. ‘No full moon ever could have brightened my night like this, nor the star constellations. No beauty could have dragged me this crazy, no beauty ever had made my eyes blind’, said his mind, but it fell among the other words in which he could never get satisfied with. ‘Beautiful’. ‘As always’, he added. <br>

It was one evening, he waited at the lawn for her to come, to discuss ‘Brida’. Having all the lines encrypted in him, he was already high in love. It was the golden hour, and she was walking slow, with the sun setting down behind her. No matter whether it was his imagination or wish after reading the book, he saw the bright light above her left shoulder. He met his soulmate, she was like an angel with a bright red aura, a Tiara, nature gifted her. It was like the sun itself was setting inside her. It was the last rays left for the day, when she came close and sat near to him. She had worn a long earring with many stripes in it other than her regular short ones. He  saw the sun, so lazy, to bid goodbye to this evening, through those strips. She was giving him all the beauty of nature. Her hair was flying in the cold breeze, he could smell the fragrance of her shower gel, it was of jasmine. The breeze absorbing all her beauty entered into him, giving a shiver. ‘What was that’ she asked. It did all the destruction, adding ice to the cold, her smile and her words. He had reasons to find her beautiful, and that day she was wearing all those in her. The clouds were almost reddish, reflecting the sun or her lips or her cheeks. She was in her loose check shirt, frequently sticking to her skin and moving away with the wind. The sun was now behind her breasts and her curves were sharp as the thin rays. Her nipples were visible, she wasn't wearing a bra. The sun was setting faster now, exposing her navel as her shirt flips in the wind and finally went inside her. He sat opposite to her, finding it hard to finalize the words to describe what he felt and how beautiful she was. She knew he was going to tell something, she looked at him. <br>

Memories flashed before his eyes as she kept the book inside her bag. She looked at him, she could see the words behind his lips. She can read his movements and words even at night, they were one soul separated into two bodies. Their eyes locked, and everything else. Their eyes didn't blink, their bodies motionless, air around them, stagnant. No cars honked, people in the street disappeared, the world stopped along with them. In a second, everything was back to normal, except the separated souls. Unrest shook them, breathing heavily, eyes staring at horizons, hands shaking and legs uprooted from the earth. 'Let's walk', he said, breaking the silence. <br>

They walked, slower than their regular pace. They knew all the steps they took. It was the regular pathway they used to walk, with days the wider path shrunk towards the corner, and they disappeared to one dark corner till both lost their breaths. They passed all those, remembering everything and knowing the other does too, holding hands and sometimes brushing their shoulders.<br>
There was an army of ants walking through the pavement. One by one, following the one ahead, they walked. Everything had something ahead and something following behind. She thought of how her body was kissed by him every time they made love. Every kiss had another followed and progressed, toe to head or head to toe, measuring every inch of her skin. Like the army disappearing to the depth of earth, kisses measured her depth to infinity.<br>

Walking along, they crossed a tree which brought smiles on them. The tree was the witness for their first kiss, when the ant bit her for the first time. They walked past the tree to a shade which was lonelier, from the first kiss to now, they seek spaces where they could be together. The search before the first kiss was long and vigilant. Everyone remembers only the first, the first human to do something, the first form of something, the first date and even the non-existing virginity has the life of a first time. It was another night like this, and they were walking, holding hands and stopped under the tree for shade from other eyes. The tree was big enough with leaves like ornaments to give them a safe space. They weren't prepared for the first time like they weren’t prepared for the night they were walking into. They reached a corner, a new one for them, it was dark with barely some light from a distant street lamp. <br>

They have thought about this night from the day they first kissed under the tree. A night from when all things they loved till then will be added to their grieves, the idea of another day becomes an icon of pain. The kiss was prolonged with all these thoughts, and with time the desire became intense. Both knew that they were going to kiss, and they found it hard to look into each other’s eyes. When the thought about the distant day changed to the nearer days of togetherness, the skin ached to be close, lips dried in desperation. The cold wind made them warm and the moon closed its eyes with clouds. But that night's moon didn’t blink, the wind was too cold, making their bodies freeze like dead. They couldn’t look anywhere other than the other's eyes. They had all good memories behind, the kisses, the touch, which made the kiss wait longer. <br>

They were holding hands for a long time, like the night of the first kiss, when their faces swinged close and back with hands held together, strong. The kiss had to wait for the beginning, the shivering lips and closed eyes came closer several times to meet finally for the first time. Like two beaks, they pecked each other. And the shivering started to lose its frequency, hands slowly became loose, they looked at each other. Like a wave, their faces closed, hands stronger, ending the calmness their lips kissed till both became breathless. <br>
They could never end a day without a kiss since then. But standing close that night, they felt it all different. The infinite kisses didn’t help them to ease their bodies. Their lips shivered and their feet couldn't hold them on to the ground. <br>

With lips talking, everything blurred around them. They felt like being in a distant land where people loved each other, people sang about love and lovers never asked names before they fell for the other. But everything was so clear that night, they feared all shapes around them. The wind which carried the moon’s fragrance today carries some odd smell from the corner. The distant light showed them the days ahead rather than just the eyes which made them love all the time. They kissed deep, from the middle, not from the start, their lips parted without an end. It was not the first, but first to new days. It was not the last, but last to the old days. Neither the beginning it was, nor the end.
