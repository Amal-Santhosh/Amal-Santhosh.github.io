 <h2>Closely Far</h2>
 <p>Many times there is no need for them both to come,<br>
Close, to see; to feel; to embrace.<br>
Along the bank of the same river they stood,<br>
Close, but unknown to each other.<br>
Looking through every drop flowers carried,<br>
Of the last night's rain; for the other,<br>
They saw the same eyes looking at them.<br>
They kissed; <br>
Carrying the depth of all emotions, love;<br>
Far from each other; kissing each other.<br>
