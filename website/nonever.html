	<h2>No, Never</h2>
	<p>No pen moves under same head in different papers easily, holded by same thumb.<br>
    No sky carries both the rays of sun and moon with it, at the same time.<br>
    No hand will hold the other around the wrist, if it was woven together once.<br>
    'No' was terrible at times when we parted for long,<br>
    Even more, when you were not mine near me.<br>
    But<br>
    No eyes will stop gazing from miles, <br>
    No smile will stop with deepened wrinkles,<br>
    No miles will part us within.</p>
