	<h2>Time</h2>
	<p>Time, you always play a crooked game<br>
    And love hinders the path with more twists and turns<br>
    Tales were said in ears softer; to hear slower<br>
    Words split into many to prolong the tale.<br>
    Little does love do. <br>
    It let nothing feel losing; even time.<br>
    All it takes is time. Even time to love.</p>
